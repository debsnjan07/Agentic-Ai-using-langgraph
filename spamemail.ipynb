      "| **All‑caps and emphasis** – “MUST verify your identity IMMEDIATELY”, “FINAL WARNING” | Over‑use of capitalization and bold language is typical of phishing attempts. |\n",
      "| **Threat of severe consequences** – “Immediate account suspension”, “Loss of all funds”, “Reporting to authorities” | Creates a sense of panic to bypass rational decision‑making. |\n",
      "| **Suspicious link** – `http://secure-bank-login.com/verify?user=yourname&token=ABC123XYZ` | The domain does **not** match the legitimate bank’s domain (e.g., `bank.com`). The URL is a clear red‑flag. |\n",
      "| **Fake contact information** – “1‑800‑FAKE‑NUM”, “www.realbank.com (fake link hidden)” | The phone number is obviously a placeholder; the “realbank.com” link is described as “fake”. |\n",
      "| **Generic greeting** – “Dear Valued Customer” | Legitimate banks usually address you by name; generic salutations are common in spam. |\n",
      "| **Poor formatting / spelling** – Minor grammatical oddities, inconsistent punctuation | While not always present, many phishing emails contain subtle errors. |\n",
      "| **Request for credential verification** – “CLICK HERE to secure your account” | Phishing emails aim to harvest login credentials or personal data. |\n",
      "| **Time pressure** – “within 24 HOURS” | Short deadlines push recipients to act without thinking. |\n",
      "| **Unusual sender address (not shown but typical)** | Phishing emails often come from addresses that mimic the real brand but have slight variations. |\n",

      "1. **Check the sender’s email address** – Look for exact domain match (e.g., `@bank.com`).  \n",
      "2. **Hover over links** – Do not click. Verify the actual URL; legitimate banks use HTTPS and their official domain.  \n",
      "3. **Contact the institution directly** – Use a phone number or website you know is genuine (e.g., from a bank statement).  \n",
      "4. **Look for spelling/grammar errors** – Official communications are usually proof‑read.  \n",
      "5. **Never provide personal credentials** – Banks will never ask for passwords or verification codes via email.  \n",
